# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

In this course, I was solving the problem of trying to decide on and implement an efficient data structure to read in and organize data
and be able to efficiently pull that data in a search or list on user request. I approached this problem by looking at each data structure
that we studied and seeing how much resources each used and which data structures were the most efficient in their respective categories. 
Data structures are important to understand since the way that they function is wildly different and some data structures excel at taking in 
data while others excel at returning data and there's also data structures that serve as a good middle ground between the two. Looking at 
what you're looking to do with the data and what your resource load is can be key when trying to decide on the best data structure for the
given application. The most difficult part of the project for me was trying to make an efficient parser to properly take in the data from 
the file for the algorithm to sort. It took some trial and error and some research but was something that I was able to figure out by 
putting my nose to the grindstone. This project has given me more perspective on managing resources when choosing algorithms, has exposed
me to various algorithms, and also by giving me some basis of what to consider when deciding which algorithm to use in an application. I'll
definitely look at future projects through a different lense since taking this course.
